# relatedlist-lwc
reusable related list lwc, with configurable row level and list level actions. This helps resolve limitations on standard related list(s) when used in Communities that standard actions can't be overridden and custom list actions are not supported.

Future Enhancements:

* Inline Editing

* Flow for configuration
    * RL
    * Fields
    * Custom Actions
    * Query Filters 
    
* Column Level Filter (filter values are automatically determined by distinct values in all rows...may be a little overhead?)


_*Known Issues*_

* Related List does not refresh on standard Edit action.
* Record Type Selection and Default Field Values not supported in Communities.
